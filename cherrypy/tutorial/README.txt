CherryPy Tutorials
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a series of tutorials explaining how to develop dynamic web
applications using CherryPy. A couple of notes:

  - Each of these tutorials builds on the ones before it. If you're
    new to CherryPy, we recommend you start with 01_helloworld.py and
    work your way upwards. :)

  - In most of these tutorials, you will notice that all output is done
    by returning normal Python strings, often using simple Python
    variable substitution. In most real-world applications, you will
    probably want to use a separate template package (like Cheetah,
    CherryTemplate or XML/XSL).

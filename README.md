Note: I haven't worked on Gamez in 2 years. I am now starting from scratch and rewriting it, starting with a windows based console, instead of python. I am hoping to have a working copy by the end of 2013. Please search for Gamez Server under Riveu.

Gamez is currently in *Alpha* release. There may be bugs in the application.

Gamez is an automated downloader for video games. The user adds the games they wish to download and Gamez will attempt to find the game and download it.

As of the current release, only Wii and Xbox 360 games are supported. More systems will be supported in future releases

Current Features:

    * Local database of all Wii games
    * Automatically sends NZB's to Sabnzbd
    * Support for NZBMatrix and Newznab

***Dependencies***

Gamez requires Python and CherryPY. The CherryPy module is included with Gamez. Python must be installed on the system on which Gamez will be ran.
